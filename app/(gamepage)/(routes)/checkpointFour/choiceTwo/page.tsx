        Walking around the lunch room, you eventually single out a particularly weak looking freshman talking about taking English with Mrs. Shupp. You put your hand on their shoulder, stare into their eyes, and utter “I’ll tell her you’re using AI.” You aren’t sure of this, but you know you’ve got at least an 8/10 chance. They immediately fold and give you their entire wallet. Riding off this high you press them for their bank information, to which they reply, “Don’t get greedy,” and walk off.

        The day carries, and each period seems to flow directly into the next. Eventually, the bell rings for lunch and you make your way to the Commons. On your way, you make a stop by the restroom. As you open the door the putrid scent of vapor nicotine assaults your nostrils. It’s as though a fog machine was running in one of the stalls, and the entire room is packed with sophomores vaping. To use one of the stalls, you’d need to push your way to one of the stalls, potentially putting yourself at risk for their sophomore ire. Alternatively you could make your way to another restroom, but that would take a long time and eat away at your lunchtime.

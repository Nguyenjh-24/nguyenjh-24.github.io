        You make your way to the kitchen, when you remember that your parents haven’t visited the grocery store yet this week. There’s next to no food in the house, and you desperately search the place for any small morsel you can find. Eventually you find the following: A half eaten box of plain Cheerios, a cup of possibly expired yogurt, and a radish. You might be fine with the Cheerios normally, but there’s no milk left, only almond milk (disgusting). On the other hand, eating the Yogurt is a gamble, and there’s a chance it’ll turn your intestines into a ticking time bomb.

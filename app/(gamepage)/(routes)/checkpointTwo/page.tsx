        It’s period 3, your study hall for the day. You consider working on your English Project that is due Friday night, but that’d be so boring. After all, it’s only Tuesday, you should have time to work on it later. Wait, isn’t it Thursday? Or is it Wednesday? Eh, what does it matter? You could do something more enjoyable like watch the next episode of Chainsaw Man, although your classmates might see you as a weirdo for doing so (for good reason). Of course, you could always catch up on your lost sleep and nap through the period, but then you’d end up doing nothing productive. But would you really be productive anyway?
